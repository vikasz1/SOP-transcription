00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Okay, so I hope this is clear to me.

So today I am going to show you how to set up GoLama on this computer.

00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:22,200
What you need to do is you need to type GoLama run llama 3.2 where llama 3.2 is the name

00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,120
of the model.

00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,940
And this is just a test video to figure out if I am able to test type the video or not.

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,880

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,880
Okay.

00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
Goodbye.

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Bye.
