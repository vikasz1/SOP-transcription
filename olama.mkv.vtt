Okay, so I hope this is clear to me.

00:06.800 --> 00:13.600
So today I am going to show you how to set up GoLama on this computer.

00:13.600 --> 00:22.200
What you need to do is you need to type GoLama run llama 3.2 where llama 3.2 is the name

00:22.200 --> 00:24.120
of the model.

00:24.120 --> 00:30.940
And this is just a test video to figure out if I am able to test type the video or not.

00:30.940 --> 00:32.880
So that is just a test video.

00:32.880 --> 00:33.880
Okay.

00:33.880 --> 00:34.880
Goodbye.

00:34.880 --> 00:35.880
Bye.

00:35.880 --> 00:36.880
Bye.

00:36.880 --> 00:37.960
Recording stop.
